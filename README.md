# React Native AsyncStorage: Accessing Data Before Retrieval

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving AsyncStorage: attempting to access data before its retrieval is complete.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

**Problem:**
Asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from AsyncStorage, require proper handling to prevent race conditions. Accessing the data before the `getItem` promise resolves can lead to undefined values, errors, or unexpected application behavior.

**Solution:**
Always wait for the promise to resolve using `.then()` or `async/await` before using the retrieved data.  This ensures that the data is available and prevents premature access.
